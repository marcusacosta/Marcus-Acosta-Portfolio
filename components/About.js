          <p>I&apos;m an aspiring software engineer who&apos;s drawn to backend development because I love working on the invisible layers that people depend on every day. What sets me apart is my excitement for the breadth of backend work from designing APIs and shaping data in SQL/NoSQL databases to building distributed systems and infrastructure. I&apos;m seeking software engineering internships where I can apply this mindset to impactful projects.</p>
